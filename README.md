**VTU 6th SEM Information Science and Engineering File Structures lab programs in C++.**


### Contents

**[Experiment 1](https://github.com/shubham16sky/File-Structures-Lab/blob/main/Firstpgm.cpp) :
Write a C++ program to read series of names, one per line, from standard input and write these names spelled in reverse order to the standard output using I/O redirection and pipes. Repeat the exercise using an input file specified by the user instead of the standard input and using an output file specified by the user instead of the standard output.**

In this program i have used fstream class for basic file I/O in C++.
first create a file in working directory which contains names  to use it as Standard Input.
